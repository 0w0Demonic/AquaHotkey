# AI Prompts for AquaHotkey

This directory contains prompts that can be used with custom AI agents to provide
specialized knowledge about this library.

These files are meant to be used as prompts so that an AI assistant can
understand and AquaHotkey effectively.

## How to Use

Directly feed the prompt to your AI assistent, or integrate it into its
context or knowledge base.

## Structure

`Module_AquaHotkey.md` covers the core AquaHotkey component (i.e.: the extension
system for adding custom methods and properties).

Depending how well this works, I might add more prompts to cover the extended
standard library with all of its separate utilities in later updates.

The idea for this setup was inspired by [ClautoHotkey](https://github.com/TrueCrimeAudit/ClautoHotkey),
a GitHub repository containing prompts, modules and scripts for making useful
AutoHotkey v2 projects with LLMs.
