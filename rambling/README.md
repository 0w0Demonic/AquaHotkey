# Incoherent Rambling

Welcome to the **rambling/** folder. It's a place where I dump thoughts,
half-formed ideas, and occasionally some insights about AquaHotkey.

This isn't documentation, it's more like a dev diary of some sort. Things
that I'm experimenting with, possible features, you name it.

You might find:

- Random experiments
- Half-formed ideas that may or may not become features
- Occasional real-world examples
- Thoughts about making the library more useful and easier to work with
