# Contributing

Thanks for taking your time to contribute! <3

Contributions to any of the following is always welcome and appreciated:

- documentation,
- example scripts,
- tests,
- and most of the extension and utility classes.

## Utilities

Utilities should aim to be useful, generic, and reusable.
Also, please also add one or two (basic) tests, that'd be much appreciated.

I'd be especially greatful for help with creating new extension classes for
`Gui` and related GUI classes. It's where AquaHotkey shines the most, yet
no "official" extension classes exist (although they absolutely should).

## Don't Touch the Internals

As for the "core part" of AquaHotkey (i.e., anything in `Src\Core`), I won't
accept direct changes to any of the code there.

If you think there might be a bug, no matter how small, feel free to open an
issue and I'll do my best to fix any problems.
